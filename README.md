# nextflow-metatropics-demo
A small tutorial on the [metatropics](https://github.com/DaanJansen94/nf-metatropics/) Nextflow pipeline to perform viral identification and creation of consensus genomes.

## Input


## Explain first what what is, readsin input and excel file
## Databases in ... 
## metatropics nextflowpipeline in 'nf-metatropics'
## We can run this pipeline by the following command (show command) + explain using docker to pull software required and in yaml file the actuall path where input is, output will beo stroed etc


```
nextflow run nf-metatropics/ -profile docker -params-file params.yaml -resume
```
